Yahya Rashid, a UK national from northwest London, was detained at Luton airport on Tuesday after he arrived on a flight from Istanbul, police said. He's been charged with engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism, and with engaging in conduct with the intention of assisting others to commit acts of terrorism. Both charges relate to the period between November 1 and March 31. Rashid is due to appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, police said.

Mexican state oil company Pemex said 45 workers were injured in the blaze, which began early Wednesday morning. Two of them are in serious condition, the company said. Authorities evacuated about 300 people from the Abkatun Permanente platform after the fire started, Pemex said. At least 10 boats worked to battle the blaze for hours. The fire had been extinguished by Wednesday night, Pemex said in a Twitter post. The company denied rumors that the platform had collapsed and said there was no oil spill as a result of the fire. The state oil company hasn't said what caused the fire on the platform, which is located in the Gulf of Mexico's Campeche Sound. The fire began in the platform's dehydration and pumping area, Pemex said. CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.""","""(CNN)#UporDown? That's the trending question on social media, thanks to a photo of a cat coming down some stairs. Or is it going up some stairs? (And you thought you were done with this kind of optical illusion free-for-all after #TheDress.) The picture was apparently uploaded on Imgur a few days ago and has caught fire thanks to a post on the website 9gag.com. Some people are noting the apparent motion of the cat. Others are commenting about the construction of the stairs. (Nobody has mentioned that some cats we could name would be more likely to stop in the middle of the steps and play with a mousie.) Of course, where there's public debate, there are advertisers waiting to take advantage of the situation. Taxes? Now, those are REALLY confusing.""","""Sim Bhullar and the Sacramento Kings are about to make NBA history. The Kings are signing Bhullar to a 10-day contract that will make him the league's first player of Indian descent, a person with knowledge of the deal said on Wednesday. The person spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Kings are not expected to announce Bhullar's deal until Thursday, when David Wear's 10-day contract expires and a roster spot opens up. Sim Bhullar is set to become the NBA's first player of Indian descent with the Sacramento Kings . The 7-foot-5, 360-pound Bhullar is being called up from the team's NBA Development League affiliate, the Reno Bighorns. The 22-year-old centre will be on the roster on Friday when the Kings host the New Orleans Pelicans.

Cook resumed on 95 and reached three figures with minimal fuss before retiring out. England captain Alastair Cook completed a century on the second morning of England's opening tour match . A controlled thick edge from the first ball of the day brought him an 11th boundary of the innings and in the following over he punched the ball for two off the back foot. He offered a gentle wave of the bat and a handshake to partner Gary Ballance and walked off on 101 from 200 deliveries. That allowed Ian Bell to arrive at the crease, with batting time more important to the tourists than attempting to force a result in this two-day fixture.
